              <h2>LWC Pay Fees Feature is Coming Soon</h2>
              <p>
                Crypo is the DEX platform powered by Linework Corporation !
    
    Cryptocurrencies are expected to gradually become a way of life but the technology is still 
    in its infancy: there are many adoption barriers to break and its needs adoption by as many 
    people as possible.
    
    With almost everyone wanting to have a share in the now $126 billion crypto market, there is 
    need to find out which coin and company to go for, which depends on the versatility and ability
    of its base technology, uniqueness of business idea and growth potential.

     Faced with the event of new crypto payment technologies in the world with “bitcoin” as an 
    initial reference, Linework is positioning itself as a major blockchain player in the world 
    of virtualization of global processes and of globalization in terms of communication decentralized. 
    
     Already through its social network, Linework is a global player in the decentralization of the 
    assets of everyone by dematerializing web marketing structures, physical contacts wherever you 
    are in the world.
    
    Linework is a central player in change and in area 4.0, which brings together crypto- payments 
    which in particular can be used on Linework platforms as a benchmark.

    LWC (Linework Coin) is therefore positioned as a choice, strategic and secure value for your 
  investments in cryptocurrencies. LWC operates on the blockchain and benefits from its own block, 
    its security based on the HA512 algorithm and sequential block encryption in the Ethereum Blockchain-based.

    LWC does not require a super IT structure and is an accessible token on the CRYPO EXCHANGE platform. 
    
    Finally, the integrity of LWC is guaranteed in the same way as Bitcoin, in a decentralized manner 
    accessible by a personal WALLET and secured by the "seed phrase", a "strong" password and an 
    interface accessible by an application available for IOS, MacOS, Android or Windows. The LWC 
    is transferable to a nano ledger in the form of a secure USB key.

    It is more reassuring to invest in rising stocks that have not yet reached their peak state, which 
  therefore do not risk falling. The BTC falls more and more every day and the holders of assets in BTC, 
    other than having the faculty to transform them into physical currency, can no longer make investments 
    on this currency since it no longer brings anything in the trading rooms.

    The LWC is therefore positioned as a real investment tool, for funding the Linework Social Network 
    and for enhancing artisanal, commercial, social and societal activity in developing countries or 
    countries in economic difficulty or in deficit of democracy.

    Linework is performing as a real geopolitical and geostrategic tool working for the liberty and 
    freedoms in the world, but not also, Linework Social Network involved a new financial and social 
    power in parallel of central banking organization for completing the actual financing institution 
    to be stronger than ever.
